#### Intro
This is basic firmware for use with the Coobro Geo device which can be
purchased at http://coobrolabs.com.  The most important thing you need to
change in this code is the GPS coordinates of the 5 locations you wish
to navigate to.  Please go to www.coobrolabs.com/contact if you need
any help.

#### This firmware wouldn't exist without help from the following individuals:
#### Mikal Hart (www.arduiniana.org)
Author of both the TinyGPS library, as well as the NewSoftSerial library.
There is no doubt that the Coobro Geo would not exist if it wasn't for
the efforts of this individual.

#### Sean Carney (www.seancarney.ca)
Special thanks to Sean for creating and documenting his Arduino GPS System.
This was my original inspiration for creating the Coobro Geo.  His code was
used to help figure out the best way to navigate to a GPS coordinate.
